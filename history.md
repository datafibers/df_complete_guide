# History
There is a flood of interest in learning how to processing data in large-scale systems in terms of extract, transform, load in real time, partly because there are situations in which the time-value of data makes real-time analytic so attractive and important. 

But gathering in-the-moment insights with complex data processing in the fly is extremely difficult. Although, there are available big data framework or applications available to such use case, there are either too complex to use or not capable for the job alone. In addition, most time we need to combine both history data and real-time data together because history data accumulate values and asset for prediction and tuning the data in the fly.

### Architecture
The big data processing architecture evolves with the speed of demanding values behind of data. Architecture of big data processing have three type of symbols

#### Batch


#### Hybrid


#### Unified
